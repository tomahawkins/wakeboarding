# EMWWA: Edge More Wakeboarding and Waterski Association

Yay!  Summer 2021!  Boat is running and ready to go!

**Recommended Equipment:**

- 2/3mm or 3/4mm (recommended) wetsuit that fits.  A loose suit is like no suit at all.
    - [Evo's wetsuit guide](https://www.evo.com/guides/wetsuit-thickness-and-temperature-chart)
    - [Bellingham Bay water temperature](https://www.seatemperature.org/north-america/united-states/bellingham.htm)
- Water shoes.
- Gloves for the descent.


**Safety:**

- Only one person on the descent rope at a time.
- No horseplay with the raft ladder.  Please leave it in the water.
- Beware of barnnecals.  They cut!  Use extra caution when swiming near the shore or the raft.
- While wakeboarding:
    - When in doubt of something, let go of the rope.
    - If you get too close to shore, let go of the rope.
    - If you get caught deep inside the wake on a turn, let go of the rope.


**Signals:**

- Thumbs up: Go faster.
- Thumbs down: Go slower.
- Pointing at the raft: I'm done for now.
