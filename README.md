# EMWWA: Edge More Wakeboarding and Waterski Association

Yay!  Summer 2021!  Boat is running and ready to go!

We plan to be on the water most evenings when the tide is above 4',
the wind is low, and the weather is good.

**Recommended Equipment:**

- 2/3mm or 3/4mm (recommended) wetsuit that fits.  A loose suit is like no suit.
    - [Evo's wetsuit guide](https://www.evo.com/guides/wetsuit-thickness-and-temperature-chart)
    - [Bellingham Bay water temperature](https://www.seatemperature.org/north-america/united-states/bellingham.htm)
- Water shoes.
- Gloves for the descent.


**Safety:**

- Only one person on the descent rope at a time.
- No horseplay with the raft ladder.  Please leave it in the water.
- Beware of barnacles.  They cut!  Use extra caution when swimming near the shore or the raft.
- Careful on the beach.  There is glass and thorns of every type.
- While wakeboarding:
    - When in doubt, let go of the rope.
    - If you get too close to shore, let go of the rope.
    - If you get caught deep inside the wake on a turn, let go of the rope.


**Signals:**

- Thumbs up: Go faster.
- Thumbs down: Go slower.
- Pointing at the raft: I'm done for now.


**Daily Procedure:**

1. If we plan to go out, I'll send out a text about an hour before hand.
2. We'll meet at our driveway and hike together down to the water.
3. Everyone lends a hand getting the boat ready and in the water.
4. We clean off the raft and scrap the floats to remove barnacles.
5. Wakeboarding and skiing: Next person gets ready to go from the raft
   while someone else is skiing.  Fast transitions so everyone gets a turn.
6. When we are done, we tie up the boat and transport all the gear to the shore.
7. We then swept the beach for trash and move driftwood out of the way.
8. We climb back up the hill together and then depart -- unless it's a movie night.
